// pair `[entrantA, entrantB]` where either side may be `null` if there
// weren't enough entrants to fill the bracket evenly (a "bye" - the other
// side advances automatically, no match played). Rounds after the first are
// returned only as a *count* of matches (pairs of `null`), since who plays
// in them depends on results that don't exist yet - the caller links
// fixtures across rounds via nextFixtureId/nextFixtureSlot instead.
//
// No real seeding (e.g. by past performance) is implemented - entrants are
// paired in the order they're given, byes falling on the tail end of the
// list. That's a reasonable v1 default; proper seeding is a small, isolated
// improvement for later (sort `entrantIds` before calling this).

// Double-elimination bracket seeding.
//
// v1 scope: requires the entrant count to be an exact power of two (4, 8,
// 16, 32...). A double-elimination losers bracket works by interleaving
// newly-eliminated players with the losers bracket's existing survivors,
// round by round - the arithmetic for that only lines up cleanly when every
// winners-bracket round produces exactly half as many losers as the round
// before it, which is only guaranteed when the winners bracket has no byes
// at all. Non-power-of-two fields should use single elimination (which
// already handles byes correctly) or add/remove an entrant to reach a power
// of two - the caller is expected to validate the count and produce a
// friendly error before calling this.
//
// Returns:
//   winnersRounds: identical shape to buildBracketRounds()'s return value -
//     round 0 has the real entrant pairs, later rounds are counts only.
//   losersRounds: an array of `{ matchCount, feedsFromWinnersRound }`
//     describing the losers bracket, in play order:
//       - `feedsFromWinnersRound` is the 0-indexed winners-bracket round
//         whose losers join this round, paired against whatever the losers
//         bracket already has (or against each other if it has nobody yet).
//       - `feedsFromWinnersRound` is `null` for a pure "consolidation"
//         round, where the losers bracket's own survivors just play each
//         other to halve the pool before the next round injects new losers.
//     Like buildBracketRounds, only the *shape* is returned - actual
//     entrant IDs for anything beyond winnersRounds[0] are only known once
//     earlier matches are played, and are wired up by the caller via
//     nextFixtureId/nextFixtureSlot (winner advances) and
//     loserNextFixtureId/loserNextFixtureSlot (loser drops to the losers
//     bracket) on each generated fixture.
