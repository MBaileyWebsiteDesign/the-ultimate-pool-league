// base, plus a placeholder describing what's coming once team leagues
// launch - so there's a real, working page behind the "Captain Portal" nav
// link rather than a dead end.

          Team leagues are on the roadmap. Once they launch, this is where you'll manage your
          team's roster, nominate players for each leg of a match, and see your team's
          upcoming fixtures - all gated to just the team(s) you captain. For now, captain
          status doesn't unlock anything extra beyond this page, since the app is singles-only.
